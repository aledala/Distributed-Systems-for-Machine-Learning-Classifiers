# Distributed-Systems-for-Machine-Learning-Classifiers

Problem Statement
Implement a Distributed System for machine learning classifiers for improved performance by distributing parameters over different servers. We would further analyze the effect of feature size and number of parameters, used for fine-tuning the algorithm, on the performance of classifier.
